          From Maine&apos;s serene coast to the busy streets of NYC and now
          adding rhythm to Richmond, VA, Sam Parker&apos;s journey through jazz
          is a fusion of artistry and experience.

          Under the mentorship of Andy LaVerne, (a student of Bill Evans), Sam
          refined his craft at the esteemed Hartt School of Music. Sam&apos;s
          piano instantly enhances an event with his knowledge of the American
          songbook and over a decade of experience playing jazz piano at clubs
          and parties.

          noise; it&apos;s an atmosphere enhancer, tailored to the energy of
          each event. His sensitivity and intuition transform gatherings into
          unforgettable experiences, where sophistication meets spontaneity.
